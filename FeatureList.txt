Things that we need to add (and my thoughts of how to implement them):
- Priority 1: Day / Night Cycle
- - Set a asynchronous function that sets a timer (also on screen) that ticks down, and when it hits zero it turns to night.
- - When the night is over, a new screen pops up and tells you if you were okay or not during the night
- - Regenerate the original scene to spawn new pickups and change the level, resetting the timer and carrying over the health.
- - Less food spawns each day so you cannot just win it immediately in one day
- Priority 1: Predator
- - When night hits, the game spawns in a predator somewhere random on the map (on the edges only, and far enough away from the bird)
- - Constantly moves towards the bird (slower than your movement speed) and if they touch, you lose health during the night
- - To escape it, you have to have a built nest, and press space on it during night to rest, or hurry to finish building it before caught.
- Priority 2: Multiple Birds
- - I make more sprites (a given)
- - The bird is selected at the start after clicking to start, and the bird chosen sets a variable for which bird is spawned and played as
- - The health given for each food is based on this variable, such as follows:
- - If (redbird) on blueberry, then +10hp, and if(blackbird) on blueberry, then something else
- - At the end of the game, instead of just resetting everything by playing again, takes you to bird selection screen

- As Needed: Other
- - (For me) Make a second sprite of the bird walking, to make the bird feel more alive
- - (For me) Make a sprite of the predator, and a sprite of the bird in its nest for the day end screen
- - Set up in the collision function for the objects that when you're hovered over it, a text box appears over it saying what it is
