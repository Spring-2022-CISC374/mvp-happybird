Things that we need to add (and my thoughts of how to implement them):

- Priority 1: Day / Night Cycle
- - Less food spawns each day so you cannot just win it immediately in one day
- - Overlay it so it turns dark
- - Pass health to new day

- Priority 1: Predator
- - When night hits, the game spawns in a predator somewhere random on the map (on the edges only, and far enough away from the bird)
- - Constantly moves towards the bird (slower than your movement speed) and if they touch, you lose health during the night, and also has separate end day screen
- - To escape it, you have to have a built nest, and press space on it during night to rest, or hurry to finish building it before caught.

- Priority 2: Multiple Birds
- - I make more sprites (a given)
- - The bird is selected at the start after clicking to start, and the bird chosen sets a variable for which bird is spawned and played as
- - The health given for each food is based on this variable, such as follows:
- - If (redbird) on blueberry, then +10hp, and if(blackbird) on blueberry, then something else
- - At the end of the game, instead of just resetting everything by playing again, takes you to bird selection screen


- As Needed: Other
- - Add the animation for the bird
- - Set up in the collision function for the objects that when you're hovered over it, a text box appears over it saying what it is
- - Make the text for winning centered on the screen
